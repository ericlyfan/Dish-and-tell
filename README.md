# Dish and Tell - Restaurant Tracker/Recommendations

### Project Function, Targeted Audience & Interest for Application
My goal is to design an application for food fanatics who want a fast and efficient method to store 
and keep track of restaurants that they have visited in the past. The program can also serve a 
secondary function as a restaurant recommendation system for those indecisive food lovers. 

When entering a visited restaurant into the app, you will need to include parameters such as the 
_Restaurant Name_, _Dining Environment_ (Casual, Upscale), _Cuisine Type_ (Eg. Indian, Southeast Asian, Chinese, 
Fast Food, Japanese, Korean, Western, Italian, French, Mexican, Contemporary), _Overall Rating_,
_Total Expenses_, and _Party Size_ (how many people dined).

When asking the application for a recommendation, the user may input a desired _Dining Environment_, 
a _Cuisine Type_ and a _Price Range_ ($ per person). The application will output the names of the top 3
restaurants based on an overall rating (highest rated first).

Currently, I like to keep track of the restaurants I've been to in the past along with a self-determined
overall rating in my phone's notes document. This method is tedious, and I am unable to input detailed
information about each restaurant like this application would. Additionally, there has been a lot of times
when I would struggle to decide on a place to eat,and I'm thinking how useful it would be if this program
had existed to help me choose from my previously top-rated restaurants.
